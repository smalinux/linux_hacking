How to watch dmesg live ?!

run this script: `sudo sh printk_live.sh`

### link:../main/defer_printk.c[Why printk is not showing the latest output?] module
Sometimes `printk` may defer output (that is, message is stored in the internal buffer, but not in kernel log). To avoid such behavior, always add newline (`\n`) at the end of the string printed:
....
printk(KERN_ALERT "%s*\n*" ,mystring);
....

*This is for educational perposes*, most of kallsyms unexported of link:https://lwn.net/Articles/813350/[Linux 5.7] for security reasons.

You really NEED to understand what is the meaning of EXPORT_SYMBOL,
What is the difference between extern and EXPORT_SYMBOL

Google: `The Kernel Symbol Table`, `EXPORT_SYMBOL`, `System.map`, `/proc/kallsyms`,
